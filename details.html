                Where
            </h3>
            <p> EasyJet and other airlines have regular flights to
            Thessaloniki and from there it's only 150km to Kalamitsi Campsite
            (by bus, hire car or hitching).<br /> <br />

            The campsite has its own beach, pool, bar and seaside bungalows.
            Check out <a href="http://www.thalattacamp.gr/en/pages/kalamitsicamping">
            their website</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>
                When
            </h3>
            <p>
                On Sunday 14th September. Feel free to arrive a few days in
                advance and stay as long as you please. We will be there before
                and after the event. We're not yet sure what exactly we'll be
                doing, but it will definitely involve a lot of swimming and
                dancing.
            </p>

            <h3>
                What will happen
            </h3>
            <p>
                We don't know yet, but if you are there, it's going to be magical.
            </p>

            <h3>
                What you need to do
            </h3>
            <p>
            RSVP <a href="mailto:Inauguration2014@gmail.com">by email</a> as
            soon as you can, and we will be able to block-book all the caravans
            on the beach, and establish a party domain. If you let us know
            whether you can come by the end of 2013, we can put you in touch
            with the campsite to get your accommodation for as much time as you
            want.

            <br /><br /> Caravans accommodate between four and six people, so
            you may want to think/book in groups.
            
            <br /><br />It should cost less than â‚¬15 per person, per night. The
            campsite is wondeful. Hopefully the photos above do it justice.
