                Where
            </h3>
            <p> EasyJet and other airlines have regular flights to
            Thessaloniki and from there it's only 150km to Kalamitsi Campsite
            (by bus, hire car or hitching).<br /> <br />

            The campsite has its own beach, pool, bar and seaside bungalows.
            Check out <a href="http://www.thalattacamp.gr/en/pages/kalamitsicamping">
            their website</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>
                When
            </h3>
            <p>
                On Sunday 14th September. Feel free to arrive a few days in
                advance and stay as long as you please. We will be there before
                and after the event. Not sure what exactly we'll be doing, but
                it will surely involve a lot of swimming and dancing.
            </p>

            <h3>
                What will happen
            </h3>
            <p>
                We don't know yet, but if you are there, it's going to be magical.
            </p>

            <h3>
                What you need to do
            </h3>
            <p>
            RSVP <a href="mailto:Inauguration2014@gmail.com">by email</a> as
            soon as you can, and we will be able to block-book all the caravans
            on the beach, and establish a party domain. So let us know if you
            are in by the end of 2013, and we can put you in touch with the
            campsite to get your accommodation for as much time as you want.
            <br /> <br /> Caravans accommodate four to six people, so you may
            want to think/book in groups. <br /> <br /> It costs less than â‚¬15
            per night. Hopefully the photos above do it justice. <br /> <br />
